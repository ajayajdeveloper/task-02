                But to understand the causes and effects of happiness, researchers first need to define it.</p> <p>Many of them use the term interchangeably with “subjective well-being,” which they measure by simply asking people to report how satisfied they feel with their own lives and how much positive and negative emotion they’re experiencing.In her 2007 book The How of Happiness, positive psychology researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky elaborates, describing </p> <p>happiness as “the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.”</p></div>
